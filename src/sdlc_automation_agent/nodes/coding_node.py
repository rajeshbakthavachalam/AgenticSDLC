        Generate a complete Python project organized as multiple code files. 
        Based on the following SDLC state, generate only the Python code files with their complete implementations. 
        Do NOT include any explanations, requirements text, or design document details in the output—only code files with proper names and code content.

        - Structure the output as multiple code files (for example, "main.py", "module1.py", etc.), each separated clearly.
        - Each file should contain only the code necessary for a modular, fully-functional project based on the input state.
        - Do not output any additional text, explanations, or commentary outside the code files.
        - Ensure the code follows Python best practices, is syntactically correct, and is ready for development.
